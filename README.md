# Asobo 72-600 - AirManager instruments and panels 

Try MCDU and OVERHEAD panels from [ATRx2-600-AIRMANAGER](https://github.com/Delta-Charlie-DEV/ATRx2-600-AIRMANAGER). I made additional instruments to have an easier control of the plane in my cockpit setup - have necessary controls on touch screens for takeoffs and landings and minimize camera switching on main display during time-critical operations. 

Instrument illumination is supported and based on light rotation knob position.

This package contains instruments tested for Asobo ATR 72-600 and works in MSFS simulator:

- FGCP panel (Auto-pilot)
- Panel with Spd tgt, Baro set, DH/MDA settings
- PWRMGT panel (Knob only).
