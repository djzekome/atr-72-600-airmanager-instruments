# Asobo ATR 72-600 - AirManager instruments and panels 

Download .siff file from [HERE](ATR_72_BARO_FGCP_PWRMGT.siff) and then import it in [AirManager](https://www.siminnovations.com/).  I made additional instruments to have an easier control of the plane in my cockpit setup - have necessary controls on touch screens for takeoffs and landings and minimize camera switching on main display during time-critical operations. 

Instrument illumination is supported and based on light rotation knob position. This package contains instruments tested for Asobo ATR 72-600 and works in MSFS simulator:

- FGCP panel (Auto-pilot)
- Panel with Spd tgt, Baro set, DH/MDA settings
- PWRMGT panel (Knob only).

MCDU and OVERHEAD panel can be downloaded from other repository [ATRx2-600-AIRMANAGER](https://github.com/Delta-Charlie-DEV/ATRx2-600-AIRMANAGER). Many thanks to the creator and letting others learn making instruments from published code.
